# 🧠 LLM-Powered Data Report Generator (Jupyter Notebook Edition)

This notebook project takes **any structured CSV file** and, using **LLMs + Python**, automatically generates:

- 📊 Clean charts (matplotlib, via LLM)
- 📝 Concise textual summaries (generated by LLM)
- 📄 A polished Markdown report, ready to export or present

Originally designed for **student survey analysis**, but the system is **data-agnostic** — works with any structured data.

## 🧪 Example: From Prompt to Report

### Input prompt:

> _"Topic is Common Sports per District. Description: Find out the most popular sports in each district. Generate a grouped bar chart."_

### Output:

- 🧾 Section titled "Common Sports per District"
- 📊 Grouped bar chart auto-generated with `matplotlib`
- ✍️ Summary paragraph from the LLM
- 📋 Markdown report section including chart + data

## ⚙️ How It Works (Notebook Pipeline)

1. **🔄 Load CSV to SQLite**
   - Your CSV is converted into a SQLite database for structured querying.
2. **🧠 Parse user prompts**
   - LLM transforms natural-language prompts into structured section metadata.
3. **🗃 Query or analyze data**
   - If structured: LLM writes SQL → runs on SQLite
   - If list-based: Uses `pandas` to explode, count, and summarize
4. **📈 Generate charts**
   - LLM generates Python `matplotlib` code → code is executed
   - PNG image is saved
5. **📝 Generate summary**
   - LLM writes a Markdown explanation using only the provided data
6. **🧾 Final report**
   - Combines all sections into a readable Markdown document

## 💻 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
https://github.com/pankaj7322/Data-Report-Generator.git
```

2. Install dependencies from the first cell of the notebook

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook

jupyter notebook

Open Student_Report_Generator.ipynb and run all cells (Kernel > Restart & Run All).

## 📂 How to Use
1. Replace the CSV

In the first cell:
```
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
```
Replace "your_dataset.csv" with your actual CSV file. The rest of the pipeline will adapt automatically.

2. Customise the prompts

In the cell where raw_sections is defined, enter your prompts:
```
raw_sections = [
    {
        "User_Prompt": "Topic is Student Creation Audit. Description: Analyse how many students were created by each unique 'Created By' user."
    },
    ...
]
```
3. Run the notebook

Run all cells to see the final Markdown report displayed, with charts embedded inline.
